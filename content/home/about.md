# Lab Focus

The production of nerve cells (neurogenesis) is a life-long process with regional specialization that is critical for the formation of distinct functional domains in the vertebrate nervous system. Moreover, neurogenesis in the adult nervous system may contribute to the structural changes that underlie neural plasticity, which is crucial for sensory processing and behaviour. 

My lab investigates how neurogenesis contributes to the generation and maintenance of regional nerve cell diversity throughout life. We use zebrafish as a vertebrate model system and employ a variety of technical approaches that range from histological to molecular and genetics in order to identify and characterize the molecular mechanisms that govern vertebrate neurogenesis.
